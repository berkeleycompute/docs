## Executive Summary

Berkeley Compute empowers millions of people to own a piece of the largest distributed GPU network. Berkeley Compute is developing a novel pooling protocol for scaling GPU capacity for AI workloads through decentralized datacenter operators, as well as a way to create real-world asset tokenization of GPU compute. Our solution addresses the growing demand for AI compute resources while creating new opportunities for investment and revenue generation.

### Key features:

- Decentralized GPU Network: Leveraging a distributed network of GPU owners and operators to provide compute resources at up to 70% lower cost than traditional cloud providers.
- Tokenized GPU Ownership: GPU NFTs allow fractional ownership of physical GPUs, enabling anyone to invest in and earn from the AI compute market.
- Flexible Marketplace: Customers can access spot, on-demand, or long-term rental options through time slot NFTs, catering to various compute needs and budgets.
- Blockchain-based Payments: Utilizing a burn-mint equilibrium model with Berkeley Compute tokens and Data Credits (DC) stablecoins to ensure price stability for customers and rewards for GPU providers.
- Scalable Pool Operations: Supports self-pooling, single-source datacenter pools, and distributed pools, allowing for diverse participation and operational models.

### Value Proposition:

- For Investors: Access to a new asset class tied to AI infrastructure growth
- For GPU Owners: Monetization of idle hardware without technical expertise
- For Pool Operators: Simplified capital sourcing and cluster management with automated blockchain payment rails
- For AI Companies: Scalable, on-demand access to high-performance computing

Berkeley Compute is positioned at the intersection of two rapidly growing markets: AI and blockchain. By tokenizing GPU clusters and creating a liquid market for compute resources, we're not just solving the GPU shortage â€“ we're creating a new paradigm for AI infrastructure investment and utilization.

Our MVP focuses on rapid market entry, emphasizing core functionalities to attract early adopters and demonstrate the viability of our model. With a clear roadmap for expansion, Berkeley Compute is poised to become the backbone of decentralized AI compute infrastructure.
